### [SICP] solutions in [Clojure] programming language

Each chapter resides in a separate folder for example: `chapter-1`. Inside an each folder every `*.clj` file references to a corresponding problem from the chapter for instance: `problem-1.1.clj`.

**NOTE:** I am not a professional Clojure programmer. Frankly, I didn't know it before. My intention is to solve SICP problems in a modern dialect of LISP, so Clojure was chosen. Thus many solutions can be far (or even opposite) from the good Clojure programming style and best practices. But I hope it will be better from the beginning to the end of the path.
